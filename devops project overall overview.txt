So we are changing the code on our workstation and this changes we are committing onto our GitHub repository.

From there, our Jenkins is pulling the code and building with the help of Mavin.

And it is generating a war file and we called it as artifacts, and we're pushing it onto to the Ansible

server.At the same time, it is also executing Ansible Playbook, which can create an image with the artifacts

and committed into the repository.

And also, we have created one more job that is CD job that is initiated by the Jenkins, and it is
going to initial  Ansible playbook.

This Ansible playbook execute deployment and service files on Kubernetes cluster.

However, we are trying to integrate the CI and CD job so that whenever we do some changes over

here, it should be available under Kubernetes cluster.
